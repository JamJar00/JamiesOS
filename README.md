# Jamie's OS
A simple operating system for the LaFortuna board.

Jamie's OS is a combination of Steve Gunn's Small Graphics library, my Jinput library and it also provides a number of other, newly implemented items. On top of this Jamie's OS provides a standardised naming convention for all functions so that they're less confusing from the individual libraries.

Feel free to use it in your projects and hack it how you like, beer appreciated :)
